Constructs GraphQL links for [Nhost](https://nhost.io). This package is used by
[`nhost_graphql_adapter`](https://github.com/nhost/nhost-dart/packages/nhost_graphql_adapter),
and isn't generally used directly.

If you're building for Flutter, check out
[nhost_flutter_graphql](https://pub.dev/packages/nhost_flutter_graphql) for
widgets that work great with
[graphql_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/graphql_flutter).
